Assignment 2
Project Definition
1. Write a program that takes the position of a Knight as an input on an 8x8
chessboard.
2. Given the position of the Knight, find all the possible places where the Knight can
move. You can assume that there are no pieces of the opposite color and hence no
blocks.

Notes
1. You can have this program run from the command line as well.

Extra Credits
1. Create a UI for this program which takes Knights current position as input via mouse
click on the chessboard.
2. We prefer TypeScript over Javascript and hence there are extra credits for
TypeScript.
